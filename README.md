# Us-Adidas-Sales-Analysis
![](executive_summary.JPG)

# Introduction
This project analyzes Adidas’ US sales performance in two years to understand the key drivers of revenue, demand, and profitability. Using interactive Power BI dashboards, the analysis examines sales trends across products, sales channels, and geographic regions, with the goal of turning raw sales data into actionable business insights. The findings highlight where Adidas is performing strongly and where strategic opportunities exist to optimize growth and efficiency.
# Problem Statement
  - Despite recording strong overall sales, Adidas faces several strategic questions that cannot be answered by topline revenue alone:
    - Which product categories are truly driving both sales volume and profitability?
    - How do sales channels (online, in-store, and outlet) differ in terms of customer behavior and profit contribution?
    - Which regions, states, and cities are performing exceptionally well, and which present untapped growth opportunities?
    - How does pricing influence demand, and where does price sensitivity impact unit sales?
    - Are growth and profitability evenly distributed, or concentrated in a few key products and locations?
    
Without clear answers to these questions, business decisions around inventory allocation, pricing, regional strategy, and channel optimization risk being driven by assumptions rather than evidence.
This project aims to address these challenges by analyzing Adidas’ US sales data to identify key performance drivers, demand patterns, and profit centers, ultimately providing insights and recommendations that can help improve operational efficiency and sustain long-term growth.
